Initialization: Start with a population of small, simple networks with no hidden nodes.

Evaluation: Each genome in the population is evaluated in the task at hand. Its performance is converted into a fitness score.

Speciation: The population is divided into species based on the topological and weight differences. This is done to protect innovation.

Reproduction: Genomes reproduce within their species, with the fitter ones having more offspring. Reproduction includes both cloning and crossover.

Mutation: New structure is introduced through mutations. There are three types of mutations: weight mutation, link mutation, and node mutation.

Selection: Only the best genomes from each species are carried over to the next generation.

Repeat: Steps 2-6 are repeated until an acceptable solution is found or a certain number of generations have passed.
